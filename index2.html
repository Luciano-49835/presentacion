            <p>The begginnings of the Hip-Hop started in 1970 and took place in Broux, specially in blocks parties, a kind of party with all those elements. Firstly, people from South America and The Caribbean started to expand the culture of Hip-hop due to that people form those places were not able to assist to another kind of party so they were avaible to assist there. Then people from New York follow them. <br> Thanks of DJ Kool Herc this kind of party took off in New York, due to that he did the first one. Thanks of this, he is also considers as the father of the Hip-Hop. Another important person of this culture was Bambaatta, who created the name of Hip-hop and also gave to the culture the motto "peace, love, unity and havin' fun". <br>
            Very different from today was that culture of Hip-Hop, specially if we talk about the Lyrics and this is because in those days lyrics were consider like a voice for young people of poors neighborhood. This lyrics reflected social, economics, and politics problems. <br> With the passing of the months, more and more people listened and assited to Hip-Hop's party and in 1979 the band Sugar Hill Gang recorder the first rap album. Moreover in this year lady B brought out "To The Beat Y'All", considered the first female hip hop artist </p>

                <p>During the 1983 and 1984 the New School of Hip-Hop was born with the new disks of Run-D.M.C and LL Cool J. This New School came from New York and It was characterized the insults and provocations about how others singers rapped. In addition to this it was common the politic in the lyrics. Artists during these years shown such a tough, cool, street attitude. <br>
                During 1986 hip-hop was pretty famous as comercial music, a good example is the album "Licensed to <i> III </i>" from the band "Beastie Boys" The first rap's album reaching the #1 in the Billboard's list
       
               Then in 1987 was born the Gold School, characteristic for its quality, influence and innovation. The most important artists of this era were Public Enemy, Called Quest, Gang Starr, Big Daddy Kane, Jungle Brothers and so on.
       
               To finish with this decade, we have the Gangsta Rap, a subgenre of the Hip-hop that shows the violent life of young people from slums. <br> 
               In 1987 The rapper Ice T brought out "6 in the Mornin" and it's consider like the first song of gangsta rap. N.W.A, a classic group of hip-hop, was the most common group of gangsta rap, their lyrics were absolutely violents and with many insults, specially the word nigger. This group of rappers was very controvesial and this was very clear when they made the song "Fuck Tha Police", this song made that Milt Ahlerich, an assistant of the principal of the FBI, wrote him a letter talking about the preocupation of the police in the lyrics. </p>
